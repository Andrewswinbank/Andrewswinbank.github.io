On day 1, We worked with intune and virtual machines. We looked at how intune could be used by waterstons in order to set up a vast network for clients and how virtual machines could be used to siumlate this process. To start off with we downloaded a copy of windows 10 and created an account on 365 developer in order to have access to inutne. We then used the various commands on intune to set up our virtual machines such as we toldour virtual machines to downlaod certain apps such as the camera app. We set them upwith various background images and certain privellages and banned certain things. Throughout the day we looked at how inutne can be an extremely useful tool for companies that have 100s of machines with various purposes that have to be connected to a network. We learnt how Waterstons upport this process and administrate the chnaged on intue in order to creat a secure network and a network this is specific for the client and fits their needs. We also discussed how this can be used in schools and in education to make networks safe and controlled.
