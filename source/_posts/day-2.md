On day 2 we worked with the business side of Waterstons and how they work yo try and get bids from clients and the role that they have. Firstly we sat in their planning meeting and looked at what they did on a week-week basis and the stratergies they use to be as efficient as possible. We then moved on to builidng personas in order to understand clients needs and wishes and trying to build a possible client in order to then build stratergies around this. We then did a student journey where we tracked a student through the stages of applying to university. This starts with looking at where you wnat to go and how  websites such as UCAS ans UNIfrog have sepicifc features to help people. We tracked this through the whole process of applying and univesity. We discussed the utility of apps, emials, chatbots and text messages. Finally, we learnt about how many clients now look at the UN sustainability goals when accessing IT services. We looked at Waterstons case studies and matched the UN sustainability goals to these case studies to show how Waterstons strive to be sustainable.
